# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

Tom, a Colorado Board of Elections employee has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to come up with a python script that will automate tasks and make the audit more efficient and potentially be used in the audit of other elections. In this audit, we will be performing the following:

## Election-Audit Results

•	Calculate the total number of votes cast. In order to perform this task, we set the total vote count to 0 and loop through the rows to add the vote counts. The following images give the code utilized and the result.

## Summary

The script used to perform the audit on this congressional election turned out to be a efficient and fast way than most methods and could be used to automated future elections. In order to use them for different elections there will be a need to do some modifications and adjustments.

	One modification will need to be the path to the file and the dependencies used.
	The second modification will need to happen on the variables that will be used.
